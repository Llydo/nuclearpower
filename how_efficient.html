<h1>How efficient is it?</h1>

<p>How much energy could we generate with nuclear energy in relation to coal?
    <br>
    <br>
    Well, to start off, nuclear energy is, in its most basic form, taking advantage of radioactive materials half-life as it decays using fuel rods for these materials to bounce from and to, generating nuclear reactions and heat. Similarly to how coal is formed over millions of years of pressure and condensing until we humans apply a form of energy like heat to it to release all that dense energy to power everything from chargers to whole cities!
    <br>
    <br>
    Now that you are well and truly confused, here is an example that should open your eyes to the effiency of nuclear energy.
    <br>
    <br>
    1 kg of Uranium-235, a very common material used to generate nuclear power, has the same amount of energy potential and 1,000,000 kgs of coal.
    <br>
    <br>
    That's right... a handful of nuclear material is one million times more efficient than coal...
