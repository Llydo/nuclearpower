<p id="question">So just how safe is nuclear energy?</p>
    <br>
    <p>I mean we've all heard the stories of meltdowns, no-go zones and the thousands of years it takes for nuclear material to become safe, so why would we want to make more power plants?
    <br>
    <br>
    Well, the answer quite simply is that nuclear power is much safer than any other form of energy production, and yes that does include wind, solar and tidal energy!
    <br>
    <br>
    To explain just how safe nuclear power is, let's break it down a little...
    <br>
    <br>
    In a hypothetical town of aound 27,000 homes, and was powered by coal, there would be around 25 deaths per year due to mining accidents and polution. If it was powered by natural gas, that number drops all the way down to 3 deaths per year. But if it was powered by nuclear energy... there would be 0.007 deaths per year! Not even wind or solar could compare to such a small risk to life.
    <br>
    <br>
    While Chernobyl and Fukushima were terrible incidents that highlighted the potential risks that come with nuclear energy, the fact is that poor equipment, supervison and planning was the cause of so much damage and fallout. Add onto this the fact that the public is informed so little on nuclear energy and the news media reporting only on the negatives for many decades now, it's easy to see why a vast majority of the public are so adverse to using nuclear as the driving force against fossil fuel usage.
